# White Knight Browser Extension

This is the parent repository of all submodules of our White Knight Browser Extension which we developed as part of the Medialab course at the University of Applied Science St. PÃ¶lten (BA Creative Computing, 2024). 

## Purpose
With this project we want to contribute to making our day-to-day social media experience, for now only YouTube, safer. 

## Platform
- Browser: Chromium
- Social Media Site: YouTube

## Features
1. Analyze YouTube comments
2. Detect if they are hateful or not
3. Let user's generate counter speech for these hateful comments
4. Let user's marke hateful comments on their own, if they are not detected by our extension

## Using Docker
- With docker compose you can run all the submodules (the whole extension) at once. For this, run the following command in a terminal inside of the parent folder.
> `docke compose up --build`
